# CareDesk AI — AI Front Desk Operating System for Clinics

CareDesk AI is a premium, high-fidelity **AI Front Desk Operating System for Healthcare Clinics** designed to manage the complete patient journey—from first website visit and qualification to automated follow-up. 

Rather than a simple chat widget, CareDesk AI functions as a complete **AI Front Desk Employee** that runs 24/7, helping clinics increase patient bookings, response speeds, capture revenue leakage, and reduce staff burden.
